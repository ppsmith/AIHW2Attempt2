Project: COMP560 Assignment 2

Authors:

***Coded in Python with PyCharm

Description:
The contents of this GitHub provide both model-free and model-based approaches for finding the best path to golf through a golf course. As the names suggest, the file “ModelFree.py” provides the model-free solution, and the file “ModelBased.py” provides the model-based solution. The required classes are all in this repository, as well, so please download the entire project before running.

How to Run:
The project can be downloaded from GitHub and run in any program that can read Python files (such as Pycharm). Otherwise, a command-line interface, such as the command prompt, can be used. Navigate to the file location using cd (with the path being, for example, C:\Users\blyki\PycharmProjects\COMP560_A2 but will differ from one user’s computer to another) and then type python ModelFree.py to run the Model-Free algorithm and python ModelBased.py to run the Model-Based algorithm. Afterwards, you will be prompted to enter a file path for the text file (e.g., C://Users//blyki//OneDrive//Documents//UNC//Senior//COMP560//Assignments//A2//HW2Text.txt but again, will differ computer to computer). This program assumes that the text file for the data is already downloaded. Afterwards, the best path found as well as relevant information (transition probabilities for model-based, utilities for model-free) will be printed.
